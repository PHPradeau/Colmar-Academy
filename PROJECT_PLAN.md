# Colmar Academy Landing Page Project Plan

## Project Overview
Design and implement the landing page for Colmar Academy based on provided wireframes, making informed decisions on color, typography, layout, and accessibility using only HTML and CSS.

## Objectives
- Translate wireframes into a responsive HTML/CSS prototype
- Define a cohesive color palette and typography hierarchy
- Ensure the page is accessible and meets WCAG guidelines
- Conduct code review and visual QA
- Document implementation details and compare with school-provided solution

## Deliverables
1. PROJECT_PLAN.md (this document)
2. `index.html` and supporting CSS files
3. Accessibility audit report and code review notes
4. Updated code based on review findings
5. Final README.md with documentation and code comparison
6. School solution copy and comparison summary

## Detailed Steps

### Step 1: Project Setup
- Create project directory structure
- Add placeholder `index.html`, `styles.css` and reset files
- Link CSS in HTML

### Step 2: HTML Markup
- Build semantic HTML structure matching wireframes
- Use appropriate tags (header, nav, section, article, footer)
- Include placeholder content and images from `resources/images`

### Step 3: CSS Design System
- Define root variables for color palette and typography
- Choose primary/accent colors and font families
- Set global styles (box-sizing, typography scale, spacing system)

### Step 4: Layout & Responsiveness
- Implement desktop layout using CSS Grid/Flexbox
- Add responsive media queries for mobile wireframe
- Ensure breakpoints match wireframe specs

### Step 5: Accessibility & QA
- Run Lighthouse/aXe audit for contrast, ARIA attributes
- Add `alt` text, landmarks, and focus styles
- Document issues and suggestions

### Step 6: Incorporate Feedback
- Fix reported accessibility and visual issues
- Refactor code for readability and maintainability
- Update comments and remove unused styles

### Step 7: Final Testing
- Cross-browser checks (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Device testing (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Verify keyboard navigation and screen reader support

### Step 8: Documentation & Comparison
- Write `README.md` with setup, design decisions, and usage
- Copy school solution into `school-solution/` folder
- Compare HTML/CSS line counts and code differences
- Summarize findings and learning points

## Tools & Resources
- HTML5 & CSS3
- VS Code editor
- Chrome DevTools & responsive mode
- Lighthouse / aXe accessibility extensions

## Success Criteria
- Accurate translation of wireframes into HTML/CSS
- Visually cohesive design with clear color and typography
- Fully responsive and accessible landing page
- Thorough documentation and code comparison
